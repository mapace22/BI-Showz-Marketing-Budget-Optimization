# 🎟️ Showz: Strategic Marketing Spend Optimization

## 🎯 Project Overview
Showz is a global event ticketing platform. This project serves as a comprehensive **Business Analytics** audit to determine the efficiency of their marketing investments. By analyzing user sessions, order logs, and advertising costs, I identified critical leaks in the marketing budget and proposed a high-impact reallocation strategy.



## 📊 Business Metrics & Methodology
The analysis was divided into three core pillars of performance:

### 1. Product Performance (Engagement)
* Calculated **DAU, WAU, and MAU** to understand user retention.
* Analyzed **Average Session Duration (ASL)** and **Sticky Factor** to measure platform addiction and return rates.

### 2. Sales Analytics (Monetization)
* **Cohort Analysis:** Tracked the time elapsed between the first session and the first purchase.
* **LTV (Lifetime Value):** Calculated the total revenue generated by users over time to determine their long-term value.

### 3. Marketing Efficiency (Unit Economics)
* **CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost):** Breakdown of costs per source.
* **ROMI (Return on Marketing Investment):** Identified which channels were burning cash and which were generating profit.



## 💡 Key Strategic Findings
* **The "Source 3" Red Flag:** This channel received the highest investment (USD 141,321) but yielded a **negative ROMI of -61.43%**.
* **Hidden Gems:** Sources 1 and 2, despite having higher CAC, bring in high-value customers with positive ROMIs (+49.24% and +9.61%).
* **Device Gap:** Desktop users outperform "Touch" (mobile) users significantly. Touch devices show a staggering **-56.56% ROMI**, indicating a poor mobile conversion experience.



## 🚀 Final Recommendations
1.  **Stop the Bleeding:** Immediately pause investment in **Source 3** and re-evaluate the UX for **Touch** devices.
2.  **Scale Winners:** Reallocate the recovered budget from Source 3 into **Sources 1, 2, and 9**.
3.  **Investigate Source 7:** Analyze why this "zero-cost" source is performing so well to replicate its success organically.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas (ETL & Cohorts), NumPy (Calculations), Seaborn/Matplotlib (Visual Analytics).
* **Techniques:** Cohort Analysis, Unit Economics (LTV, CAC, ROMI).
